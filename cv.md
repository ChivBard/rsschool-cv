### Some words about myself:    
Despite my education in the humanities, I have always been interested in the IT field. Even at school, there were attempts to learn PHP, but then it didn’t work for me. Then, already at the university, I had experience working with 3D design. Together with friends, we wrote an application for the phone, where I was responsible for UI / UX, but also worked a little with the code. This year I discovered a new direction for myself, namely the frontend in which I began to develop.
